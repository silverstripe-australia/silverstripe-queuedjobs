## Overview

The Queued Jobs module provides a framework for SilverStripe developers to
define long running processes that should be run as background tasks.
This asynchronous processing allows users to continue using the system
while long running tasks proceed when time permits. It also lets
developers set these processes to be executed in the future.

The module comes with

* A section in the CMS for viewing a list of currently running jobs or scheduled jobs.
* An abstract skeleton class for defining your own jobs.
* A task that is executed as a cronjob for collecting and executing jobs.
* A pre-configured job to cleanup the QueuedJobDescriptor database table.

## Installation

```
composer require symbiote/silverstripe-queuedjobs
```

Now setup a cron job:

```
*/1 * * * * /path/to/silverstripe/vendor/bin/sake dev/tasks/ProcessJobQueueTask
```

## Show job data

In case you need an easy access to additonal job data via CMS for debug purposes enable the `show_job_data` option by including the configuration below.

```yaml
Symbiote\QueuedJobs\DataObjects\QueuedJobDescriptor:
  show_job_data: true
```

This will add Job data and Messages raw tabs to the job descriptor edit form. Displayed information is read only.

## Enabling extended admin UI

In case your project has many jobs to search through and the basic UI is not enough, you can use the advanced jobs admin UI option.
This option requires the `silverstripe-terraformers/gridfield-rich-filter-header` module, though.
To enable the advanced UI simply add this config to your project.

```yaml
Symbiote\QueuedJobs\Controllers\QueuedJobsAdmin:
  advanced_admin_ui: true
```
